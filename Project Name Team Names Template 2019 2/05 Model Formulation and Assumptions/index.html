<h1 class="center">Model Formulation and Assumptions</h1>

<p class="bodytextcenter">
The main objective of our model was to determine the optimal number of tables to have in a restaurant that maximises profits given other parameters.
</p>

<p class="bodytextcenter sectionheader">
	What were the main assumptions we made?
</p>

<p class="bodytextcenter">

	Given that we were only varying the number of tables, we had to keep the other factors constant. Realistically there would be more than 1 factor that can change or should be changed to maximise profits. These were our main assumptions:
	<span>
	<li> Time taken for customers to travel around the restaurant is negligible</li>
<p>
	Since the recorded profit depends on the number of paying customers are in the restaurant and the number of seats are limited, the time taken per person affects the profits. However, we assume that the time taken is constant for all the customers to move around the restaurant and leave.
</p>
	<li>When all the seats are taken, no one enters the restaurant</li>

<p>
	It is normal for customers to still want to queue despite the restaurant being full. This would require us to either have a infinite queue that allows people to queue for the seats in the restaurant. But there would be no customers that are rejected. That is unrealistic as well. We would have had to experiment to find an optimal number of queueing spaces as the number of tables changes. As such, we decided to maintain this assumption that customers do not enter when the restaurant seats are full
</p>
	<li>Time between arrival of customers, time taken to order, time taken to eat are constant</li>
<p>
	We decided to keep these factors are constant throughout our simulation, despite the varying number of tables.
</p>

</p>
	<li>Service time for food </li>
<p>

<p>
	We assume that the customers collect their food at the cashier itself, after which they proceed to sit down. The service time for food is negligible.
</p>

</p>
	<li>Drink is ordered at cashier, but collected at dispenser</li>
<p>

<p>
	We assume that the customers order their food and drinks at the cashier and there is no delay is the preparation of drinks. Customers can simply collect their drinks without any form of a queue.
