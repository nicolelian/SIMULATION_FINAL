<h1 class="center">Abstract & Motivation</h1>

<p class="bodytextcenter">
The main goal of our project was to develop a simulation model that tied in very closely to the crooked model.
Therefore, it ties in very closely to a normal restaurant. The only difference would be that the drinks queue,
like crooked cooks is separate from the cashier queue.
</p>

<p class="bodytextcenter sectionheader">
	Why did we decide to embark on this simulation?
</p>
<p class="bodytextcenter">
	This is because we wanted to find out what was the optimal number of tables that needs to be present in the restaruant for
	restaurant to constantly have positive revenue.
</p>


<p class="bodytextcenter sectionheader">
When does one decide if they want to enter or exit the restaruant?
</p>
<p>
	<span>
		<li> When the capacity of the restaurant is full and there are no longer any available seats</li>
		<li> When the queue exceeds a certain amount of people</li>
	</span>
</p>

<p>
We will be simulating this based on the non-collliding model that was went through in class.
We collected data on tables from 1 to 10.

In order to ensure that we simulate it as realistic as possile based on customer psyche, we assume that Customers
will not want to enter the restaurant beyond a certain queue length. That is why our queue length is not equivalent to the seat capacity in our restaurant.

Enjoy the rest of the report!
