We will be taking you through a macro to micro flow of the design of our simulation
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">
Introducing our Influence Diagram:
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>
This diagram will give you an insight into all the key elements in our
restaurant that will later help you in picturing our decisions,
uncertainties that we accounted for and the objective of embarking
on this simulation project.

<br>
Let's take you through one particular scenario:
<br>
<span>
	<li> The number of customers in the pokemon restaurant increases</li>
	<li> Very intuitively, you know that the <strong>number of seats available automatically decreases</strong></li>
	<li> You also know that the <strong>availability of the cashier decreases</strong></li>
	<li> As the capacity of the restaurant fills up, the <strong>rejected customers also increases</strong></li>
	<li> As the capacity of the restaurant fills up, the <strong>queue gets longer</strong></li>
	<li> Therefore, the <strong>time spent in the restaurant also increases</strong></li>
</span>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="sectionheader">
Next, let's take a deep dive into how the back end works by looking at our modal analysis:
</p>

<div class="center">
<img class="fit2" src="modal_analysis.png">
</div>

<p>
This diagram shows you the entire flow of a pokemon customer's experience in our Alfresco restaurant.
Our agent-based simulation model has been very purposely divided into 8 different states.

<br>
<br>
Let's take you through each state:
<br>
<br>

Upon even arriving, unlike the doctor and patient non-colliding model,
their possibility of entry is not determined at the cashier. The customer decides at that point based
on a visual intake if the restaurant is full or if they would like to stand in the queue to wait.

<br>
<br>
If they don't they immediately go to <strong>"rejected"</strong>
<br>
<br>

Else, what happens is that they enter the restarurant and go from <strong> unordered to waiting</strong> when they enter the queue.
Just like the non-colliding model, when they are the next customer, they will enter the <strong>staging area.</strong>
<br>
<br>
When they are at the cashier, change to <strong>ordering</strong> and after this, they have 2 options. one of which is to go to their table to eat the food they have served, categorized as <strong> eating </strong>.
Or proceed to the drinks dispenser which is represented by <strong> ordering 2 </strong> to collect their drinks before heading to the table to eat.
<br>
<br>
After they have completed their meal, <strong> eaten </strong> they move on to the exit and get removed from the system.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
	You might have noticed that we have some assets on the screens such as the seats, cashier and drink dispenser that are fixed on the screen.

We thought that it might have been useful for your visualization therefore we have also included the state diagrams:
